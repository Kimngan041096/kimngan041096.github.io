            I am passionate about photography, always keen on the lookout for new scenes to capture, whether it's a stunning sunset or little moments that makes life special. I am also the proud owner              of a 2-year-old corgi named Boba- his playful energy keeps me on my toes and always brings a smile to my face.
        </p>        <p>            My favorite food is noodle soup- especially Pho.        </p>      </div></body>
